## Assignment Overview




In order to investigate the issue of trading wind energy in day-ahead and balancing markets, this assignment compares two models: 1) employing forecasts of wind power production before tackling the decision-making problem, and 2) using data-driven methods to directly determine the most effective bidding strategy. Along with the impact of regularisation, the approach combines a deterministic optimisation model with linear and non-linear data-driven techniques.
